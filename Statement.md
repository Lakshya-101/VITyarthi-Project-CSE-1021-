### Problem Statement

College students typically operate on tight and irregular budgets sourced from pocket money, part-time jobs, or scholarships. Frequent small expenditures on food, transportation, entertainment, and utilities often go untracked, leading to overspending, confusion about where money disappears, and financial stress toward the end of each month. Many existing expense-tracking solutions are either overly complex, advertisement-heavy, subscription-based, or require constant internet access, making them impractical for students who need a simple, private, and instantly accessible tool. This project addresses the clear need for a lightweight, completely offline, and user-friendly expense manager tailored specifically to the daily financial realities and limited technical setup of college students.
